        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Andrew Kapp, I am a student at the University of the
          Witswatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am doing a Bachelors
          of Engineering Sciences in Digital Arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy playing video games in my free time and I am in the process of
          learning to create my own projects as well. I mostly side with
          Programming and creating mechanics I have seen before but have
          recently found a joy in thinking of patchwork projects from the games
          I have played or the ones I am playing currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the goal to work as a Game Developer for intenationally
          recognized companies such as Guerilla Games, CD Projekt, or Warner
          Brothers in the hopes that I can work on rojects similar to my
          favorite games such as Horizon Zero Dawn, The Witcher franchise, and
          the Batman Arkham games which have all made significant contributions
          to my vision and hopes for the future.
