          <h4>Augmentation of the Human Intellect through the Internet</h4>
          <button onclick="collapse('intellect')">+</button>

        <summary id="intellect" class="blogEntry">
          <p>
            Augmentation refers to making something better by adding to it in
            various ways. In Douglas Englebart’s article titled Augmenting the
            Human Intellect (1962), it appeared to be an interesting and useful
            read. When thinking about Augmenting the Human Mind, I think about
            studying and learning new skills to solve new problems or find new
            paths to solve old problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such “new path” is the evolution of the engine: we began with
            the steam engine in 1698, and have since evolved the engine to
            internal combustion engines (first used in 1876), to nuclear and
            fully electrical engines. These solutions have affected us in many
            ways and have come about due to circumstances - the steam engine,
            first produced to create water pumps for mines, is now used for
            power production and as a mode of transport of people and large
            amounts of goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            This same evolution is seen in how research and literature are
            stored and accessed. The idea of a library has been used for
            centuries - a secure hold for information to be stockpiled and
            accessed by the public.This idea held out as humanity was still
            relatively small and the need to spread this information was not as
            urgent or as widespread as it is today, and so changes needed to be
            made to allow a larger population with a much wider spread access to
            the information. These Ideas introduced the thought experiment of
            the internet as we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engelbart speaks of linking skills and knowledge together, in the
            reading there are graphics and he explains them as one explains a
            mind map, the nodes and connections being equated to pieces of
            knowledge and the links between the pieces of information that make
            them useful, and that is the basis of how Engelbart planned to
            Augment Human Intellect or at least his own, by learning as much as
            he could, linking the information together and then applying his new
            found “intellect”. Finding and linking information is the basis of
            intellect and the application is brought out in the skills we
            develop and products we make.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, augmentation means to add to a system to improve it, we
            could view acquiring knowledge as adding to the system, or we could
            view the use of tools as the addition. From this perspective, the
            use of libraries can be seen as augmentation, as stores of knowledge
            and literature, it would make sense. Libraries are organized and
            most are vast and open to the public, so how would one go about
            improving the idea behind a library that seems to fulfill all the
            needs to augment human intellect?
          </p>
          <p>
            A library has some strengths; the open access and stores enough
            knowledge for many people to study many things at once. However, the
            knowledge stored within the physical library is mainly accessible to
            those in the area around the library, and knowledge is stored in
            books which need to be read to completion or to sifted through to
            uncover the knowledge within.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this, two interlaced solutions have been brought forward: the
            internet and search engines. The internet can be viewed as a
            collection of interlinked, uncategorized documents, as said these
            are linked by the internet and one can traverse between the
            documents in a sequence, each document a node, each link a
            connection. Now this does not solve the problem of having to sieve
            through literature, if anything it amplifies that problem as every
            document in the world is now a book that needs reading in the vast
            library that is the internet itself, however that is countered by
            the introduction of the search engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search engines are overlays for the internet that we can use to
            navigate the internet quickly and relatively safely by simply
            searching up the information we need and letting the engine collect
            the documents we want based on our criteria. While this is still
            only returning the documents that meet our needs, and the documents
            still require reading but most will likely hold useful information
            and links to the sources used for the article or related articles.
            So, while sieving is not yet completely removed from the research
            process, our ability to find and use documents has been streamlined
            to a point close to perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet has been an invaluable tool to augment our intellect as
            the human race, giving anyone with a connection the ability to surf
            the almost boundless stores of knowledge on offer if they were to
            look for it.

          <h4>Semantic Markup, Why Do we Need It</h4>
          <button onclick="collapse('markUp')">+</button>
        </header>
        <summary id="markUp" class="blogEntry">
          <p>
            What is semantic markup? Breaking it down: semantic means to use a
            phrase or tool in a specific way that aligns with the true meaning
            of the reference, and markup is the use of tags,headings or notes to
            create a corresponding structure or meaning. Combining these two
            ideas gives a makeshift definition of what Semantic Markup is: a
            method of placing tags throughout a document to convey the documents
            true meaning through its structure and through the comments in the
            document reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce Lawson describes markup tags to be used similar to articles of
            clothing that can be switched out and mixed and matched as needed; a
            pair of boots can be worn with sweatpants or jeans, but there are
            objective outfits in which boots are more appealing just as tags
            such as h1 and article can be used anywhere but have more
            conventional places in the document and should be used for creating
            a logical structure for the document to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with grammar, there are slight holes through which we can take
            shortcuts to craft our massages; such as using “literally” to
            emphasize intensity rather than using the word to describe the
            situation objectively or in the literal sense but these are
            semantics since the message is still received as expected but the
            message is conveyed in a more roundabout way. There are similar
            shortcuts in markup. The heading tag, h1 can be used throughout an
            entire document while the document is compiled to automatically nest
            the headings to be viewed as h2, h3, etc by the site user. However
            the system itself still views the h1 tag by the browser and the
            underlying systems that users might be using.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawson also mentions the use of assistive technologies (technologies
            used to aid the sight/hearing impaired to navigate the site with the
            same level of understanding as someone who does not experience the
            same impairment. A reviewer states in her own forum that semantic
            markup (specifically that that is used on Smashing Magazines sites)
            is important to her due to her own blindness and her standing as an
            Accessibility Engineer since her experience and absorption of a site
            relies heavily on her ability to recreate the page outline in her
            own mind through the use of a web reader. In essence, semantic
            markup is a tool that should be used to make a website readable even
            to those who cannot read it as it is or experience it like others
            do. She states how important it is that her site reader is able to
            skip over summaries on sites if she wants it to, and this is
            possible due to the use of specific tags and labels that can be
            identified by the reader and communicated to the user properly and
            whether the piece is skippable or not is also possibly communicated
            in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Conclusion Semantic Markup is an essential tool to ensure that a
            webpage has structure that follows some logic and convention to
            allow for the broadest possible user base with as few limitations
            for people with added challenges such as sight impairment. All
            containers can hold all types of data but most have uses beyond
            simply holding information and their uses could exceed the face
            value uses displayed on the web page itself.

          <h4>MetaData, Describing the Description</h4>

            What is metadata? I found myself asking this when deciding on a
            topic. The shortest definition is data about data, almost like a
            movie about a movie. Metadata is not usually meant for the user to
            see, but it can be displayed. It fits into a few categories that
            have various uses, these categories including descriptive,
            structural and administrative metadata amongst other types. Each
            piece of data, however, can be placed in multiple categories
            simultaneously; a Harvard reference is a good example, since it
            holds the author’s name (descriptive), the publication date
            (Administrative) and the document type (structural).
          </p>
          <p>
            As I said, metadata is not usually meant for direct user usage
            outside giving context about the face value data - a table without a
            heading is just arbitrary data with no context. Descriptive metadata
            can include a list of keywords that can be used by search engines to
            help users find a web page using a simple search, this type of data
            should usually be geared toward the discovery of a site - Googling
            “shopping” will bring up online shopping sites such as Takealot or
            clothing sites; the search engine understands that sites such as
            these should be suggested since the word used for the search is
            present in the keyword list for the sites even if the word
            “shopping” does not appear on the page.

          <p>
            Canvas itself makes use of administrative metadata, accounts in each
            course are assigned roles and your role determines how much
            information you have access to. Students have access to course
            content and are unable to post their own content, Teachers have
            access to all course content and are able to add content, edit
            content, make announcements and see information about students and
            assessments that students have no access to.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use metadata in HTML. We place it in the head section of the html
            page and we usually fill it with keywords, a description of the
            page, the author, site name and some site settings. These properties
            called meta tags help the search engine to understand the content of
            the page and how the page should be rendered in the browser, making
            the web page discoverable by the user, and understandable to the
            browser such that the page renders correctly according to our own
            programming and markup. The meta properties that we include in our
            HTML documents does not appear on the site itself and is read
            entirely and solely by the browser for formatting, and settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metadata is a highly useful tool that exists on and off the web,
            giving context to the data we see and deal with everyday. The web
            uses it for more elegant reasons such as page scale, structure and
            browser compatibility. Then subscriptions and accounts take it a
            step further where certain accounts are afforded higher levels of
            access to site workings or information.

            I enjoyed building this site for the simple reason it is something
            new I have never thought I would do. I always thought that if I
            wereto build a website, it would be using software like WordPress.
            However, this is possibly fr more fun than using software, since
            this method of development is probably much more flexible and offers
            many more possibilities pretty much only limited by imagination and
            know how.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said I have a long way to go, I feel I was a bit lazy and
            rushed in making this site. Between my terrible attention span,
            other subjects and the courses I chose to carry over from last year,
            I struggle to get through readings since I am not doing anything
            while I read them like in André's lectures. This is an issue and is
            affecting all my courses quite badly but is coming right with more
            time and better routine thnks to the Tuesday campus sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something I could improve on for this assignment specifically, would
            have been to not get complacent with the readings and assume I would
            find material on an entirely new subject I could understand and
            write about. My post on Metadata was my worst pice, I rushed it and
            made weak, poorly informd arguments about the subject.
            <br />
            On the reverse, I would say my piece on Augmenting the Human
            Intellect is my best so far, it was also my first so I still took
            readings, and using the reading during writing as much as possible
            instead of just meeting the word count.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the site, I would have elected to spend more time seeing what
            was possible with the styling and finding more useful examples since
            Gomez changed their site to something very different, and Chizoba's
            site was quite simple in terms of its design, and so there was very
            little in way of style examples for me to pull from in the time I
            alotted for the task.
            <br />
            However with my site almost done I am quite happy with its
            appearance, the design is simple and might be in need of some
            lightening up. The current color scheme is not as welcoming as I
            would have liked but does feel right somehow. For now I want to
            focus on making sure I am happy with my work since it is my first
            site and I am my worst critic most of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I have enjoyed aout building the site is how accessible
            information is when it comes to CSS and HTML between stackexchange,
            geeksforgeeks and other similar sites. I remember learning Java and
            my main source of help came from documentation and the textbook, but
            with CSS, there are online tutorials covering the exact problemyou
            are trying to solve and then there are multiple ways that others
            have solved a problem that you could take from.
            <br />
            A creator I follow often makes the joke about how software engineers
            are just better at googling than non engineers, and it really shines
            here with web development given all the resources that are available
            to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely feel that the skills learnt here are very important,
            firstly, web development will most likely be useful as long as the
            internet is around, and having a portfolio website on top of that
            will likely give us a better chance of getting into industry,
            especially with our portfolio already out there and in the open by
            the time we graduate.
            <br />
            I will find this particularly useful since all the career
            opportnities I have seen to this point call for a portfolio rather
            than a CV or Resumé.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I have enjoyed this assignment and this course. The
            practical component is engaging and new, and the weekly meetings are
            interesting and eye-opening. This semester has been chaotic at times
            and time is a rare resource, but I feel as routines set in and life
            returns to normal, I can begin to truly enjoy and engage in the
            courses and heir content.
