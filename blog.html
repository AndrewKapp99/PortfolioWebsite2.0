          <h4>Augmentation of the Human Intellect through the Internet</h4>
          <button onclick="collapse('intellect')">+</button>

        <summary id="intellect" class="blogEntry">
          <p>
            Augmentation refers to making something better by adding to it in
            various ways. In Douglas Englebart’s article titled Augmenting the
            Human Intellect (1962), it appeared to be an interesting and useful
            read. When thinking about Augmenting the Human Mind, I think about
            studying and learning new skills to solve new problems or find new
            paths to solve old problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such “new path” is the evolution of the engine: we began with
            the steam engine in 1698, and have since evolved the engine to
            internal combustion engines (first used in 1876), to nuclear and
            fully electrical engines. These solutions have affected us in many
            ways and have come about due to circumstances - the steam engine,
            first produced to create water pumps for mines, is now used for
            power production and as a mode of transport of people and large
            amounts of goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            This same evolution is seen in how research and literature are
            stored and accessed. The idea of a library has been used for
            centuries - a secure hold for information to be stockpiled and
            accessed by the public.This idea held out as humanity was still
            relatively small and the need to spread this information was not as
            urgent or as widespread as it is today, and so changes needed to be
            made to allow a larger population with a much wider spread access to
            the information. These Ideas introduced the thought experiment of
            the internet as we know today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engelbart speaks of linking skills and knowledge together, in the
            reading there are graphics and he explains them as one explains a
            mind map, the nodes and connections being equated to pieces of
            knowledge and the links between the pieces of information that make
            them useful, and that is the basis of how Engelbart planned to
            Augment Human Intellect or at least his own, by learning as much as
            he could, linking the information together and then applying his new
            found “intellect”. Finding and linking information is the basis of
            intellect and the application is brought out in the skills we
            develop and products we make.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, augmentation means to add to a system to improve it, we
            could view acquiring knowledge as adding to the system, or we could
            view the use of tools as the addition. From this perspective, the
            use of libraries can be seen as augmentation, as stores of knowledge
            and literature, it would make sense. Libraries are organized and
            most are vast and open to the public, so how would one go about
            improving the idea behind a library that seems to fulfill all the
            needs to augment human intellect?
          </p>
          <p>
            A library has some strengths; the open access and stores enough
            knowledge for many people to study many things at once. However, the
            knowledge stored within the physical library is mainly accessible to
            those in the area around the library, and knowledge is stored in
            books which need to be read to completion or to sifted through to
            uncover the knowledge within.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this, two interlaced solutions have been brought forward: the
            internet and search engines. The internet can be viewed as a
            collection of interlinked, uncategorized documents, as said these
            are linked by the internet and one can traverse between the
            documents in a sequence, each document a node, each link a
            connection. Now this does not solve the problem of having to sieve
            through literature, if anything it amplifies that problem as every
            document in the world is now a book that needs reading in the vast
            library that is the internet itself, however that is countered by
            the introduction of the search engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search engines are overlays for the internet that we can use to
            navigate the internet quickly and relatively safely by simply
            searching up the information we need and letting the engine collect
            the documents we want based on our criteria. While this is still
            only returning the documents that meet our needs, and the documents
            still require reading but most will likely hold useful information
            and links to the sources used for the article or related articles.
            So, while sieving is not yet completely removed from the research
            process, our ability to find and use documents has been streamlined
            to a point close to perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet has been an invaluable tool to augment our intellect as
            the human race, giving anyone with a connection the ability to surf
            the almost boundless stores of knowledge on offer if they were to
            look for it.

          <h4>Semantic Markup, Why Do we Need It</h4>
          <button onclick="collapse('markUp')">+</button>
        </header>
        <summary id="markUp" class="blogEntry">
          <p>
            What is semantic markup? Breaking it down: semantic means to use a
            phrase or tool in a specific way that aligns with the true meaning
            of the reference, and markup is the use of tags,headings or notes to
            create a corresponding structure or meaning. Combining these two
            ideas gives a makeshift definition of what Semantic Markup is: a
            method of placing tags throughout a document to convey the documents
            true meaning through its structure and through the comments in the
            document reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce Lawson describes markup tags to be used similar to articles of
            clothing that can be switched out and mixed and matched as needed; a
            pair of boots can be worn with sweatpants or jeans, but there are
            objective outfits in which boots are more appealing just as tags
            such as h1 and article can be used anywhere but have more
            conventional places in the document and should be used for creating
            a logical structure for the document to follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with grammar, there are slight holes through which we can take
            shortcuts to craft our massages; such as using “literally” to
            emphasize intensity rather than using the word to describe the
            situation objectively or in the literal sense but these are
            semantics since the message is still received as expected but the
            message is conveyed in a more roundabout way. There are similar
            shortcuts in markup. The heading tag, h1 can be used throughout an
            entire document while the document is compiled to automatically nest
            the headings to be viewed as h2, h3, etc by the site user. However
            the system itself still views the h1 tag by the browser and the
            underlying systems that users might be using.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lawson also mentions the use of assistive technologies (technologies
            used to aid the sight/hearing impaired to navigate the site with the
            same level of understanding as someone who does not experience the
            same impairment. A reviewer states in her own forum that semantic
            markup (specifically that that is used on Smashing Magazines sites)
            is important to her due to her own blindness and her standing as an
            Accessibility Engineer since her experience and absorption of a site
            relies heavily on her ability to recreate the page outline in her
            own mind through the use of a web reader. In essence, semantic
            markup is a tool that should be used to make a website readable even
            to those who cannot read it as it is or experience it like others
            do. She states how important it is that her site reader is able to
            skip over summaries on sites if she wants it to, and this is
            possible due to the use of specific tags and labels that can be
            identified by the reader and communicated to the user properly and
            whether the piece is skippable or not is also possibly communicated
            in this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Conclusion Semantic Markup is an essential tool to ensure that a
            webpage has structure that follows some logic and convention to
            allow for the broadest possible user base with as few limitations
            for people with added challenges such as sight impairment. All
            containers can hold all types of data but most have uses beyond
            simply holding information and their uses could exceed the face
            value uses displayed on the web page itself.

          <h4>MetaData, Describing the Description</h4>

            What is metadata? I found myself asking this when deciding on a
            topic. The shortest definition is data about data, almost like a
            movie about a movie. Metadata is not usually meant for the user to
            see, but it can be displayed. It fits into a few categories that
            have various uses, these categories including descriptive,
            structural and administrative metadata amongst other types. Each
            piece of data, however, can be placed in multiple categories
            simultaneously; a Harvard reference is a good example, since it
            holds the author’s name (descriptive), the publication date
            (Administrative) and the document type (structural).
          </p>
          <p>
            As I said, metadata is not usually meant for direct user usage
            outside giving context about the face value data - a table without a
            heading is just arbitrary data with no context. Descriptive metadata
            can include a list of keywords that can be used by search engines to
            help users find a web page using a simple search, this type of data
            should usually be geared toward the discovery of a site - Googling
            “shopping” will bring up online shopping sites such as Takealot or
            clothing sites; the search engine understands that sites such as
            these should be suggested since the word used for the search is
            present in the keyword list for the sites even if the word
            “shopping” does not appear on the page.

          <p>
            Canvas itself makes use of administrative metadata, accounts in each
            course are assigned roles and your role determines how much
            information you have access to. Students have access to course
            content and are unable to post their own content, Teachers have
            access to all course content and are able to add content, edit
            content, make announcements and see information about students and
            assessments that students have no access to.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use metadata in HTML. We place it in the head section of the html
            page and we usually fill it with keywords, a description of the
            page, the author, site name and some site settings. These properties
            called meta tags help the search engine to understand the content of
            the page and how the page should be rendered in the browser, making
            the web page discoverable by the user, and understandable to the
            browser such that the page renders correctly according to our own
            programming and markup. The meta properties that we include in our
            HTML documents does not appear on the site itself and is read
            entirely and solely by the browser for formatting, and settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metadata is a highly useful tool that exists on and off the web,
            giving context to the data we see and deal with everyday. The web
            uses it for more elegant reasons such as page scale, structure and
            browser compatibility. Then subscriptions and accounts take it a
            step further where certain accounts are afforded higher levels of
            access to site workings or information.

            I enjoyed building this site for the simple reason it is something
            new I have never thought I would do. I always thought that if I
            wereto build a website, it would be using software like WordPress.
            However, this is possibly fr more fun than using software, since
            this method of development is probably much more flexible and offers
            many more possibilities pretty much only limited by imagination and
            know how.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said I have a long way to go, I feel I was a bit lazy and
            rushed in making this site. Between my terrible attention span,
            other subjects and the courses I chose to carry over from last year,
            I struggle to get through readings since I am not doing anything
            while I read them like in André's lectures. This is an issue and is
            affecting all my courses quite badly but is coming right with more
            time and better routine thnks to the Tuesday campus sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something I could improve on for this assignment specifically, would
            have been to not get complacent with the readings and assume I would
            find material on an entirely new subject I could understand and
            write about. My post on Metadata was my worst pice, I rushed it and
            made weak, poorly informd arguments about the subject.
            <br />
            On the reverse, I would say my piece on Augmenting the Human
            Intellect is my best so far, it was also my first so I still took
            readings, and using the reading during writing as much as possible
            instead of just meeting the word count.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the site, I would have elected to spend more time seeing what
            was possible with the styling and finding more useful examples since
            Gomez changed their site to something very different, and Chizoba's
            site was quite simple in terms of its design, and so there was very
            little in way of style examples for me to pull from in the time I
            alotted for the task.
            <br />
            However with my site almost done I am quite happy with its
            appearance, the design is simple and might be in need of some
            lightening up. The current color scheme is not as welcoming as I
            would have liked but does feel right somehow. For now I want to
            focus on making sure I am happy with my work since it is my first
            site and I am my worst critic most of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I have enjoyed aout building the site is how accessible
            information is when it comes to CSS and HTML between stackexchange,
            geeksforgeeks and other similar sites. I remember learning Java and
            my main source of help came from documentation and the textbook, but
            with CSS, there are online tutorials covering the exact problemyou
            are trying to solve and then there are multiple ways that others
            have solved a problem that you could take from.
            <br />
            A creator I follow often makes the joke about how software engineers
            are just better at googling than non engineers, and it really shines
            here with web development given all the resources that are available
            to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I definitely feel that the skills learnt here are very important,
            firstly, web development will most likely be useful as long as the
            internet is around, and having a portfolio website on top of that
            will likely give us a better chance of getting into industry,
            especially with our portfolio already out there and in the open by
            the time we graduate.
            <br />
            I will find this particularly useful since all the career
            opportnities I have seen to this point call for a portfolio rather
            than a CV or Resumé.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I have enjoyed this assignment and this course. The
            practical component is engaging and new, and the weekly meetings are
            interesting and eye-opening. This semester has been chaotic at times
            and time is a rare resource, but I feel as routines set in and life
            returns to normal, I can begin to truly enjoy and engage in the
            courses and heir content.

            The dawning of the internet has allowed humanity to process and
            share information faster and to a much wider audience than ever
            before, however with this advance in the sharing and collection of
            knowledge certain degrees of inequalities in the form of access,
            contribution and representation have been able to creep into the
            system. These are made evident with the ability to visualise the map
            of the world in different contexts that match the aforementioned
            inequalities. <br />
            The Graham et al: Towards a study of information geographies:
            (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of
            information describes these inequalities through the use of visuals
            and uses these visuals as examples of (im)mutable augmentations of
            the world map. To define (im)mutable augmentations: it is simply to
            view something that does not change, in changing contexts - in
            Graham et al, the world map is used as the unchanging factor but the
            map is altered slightly to show different contexts in the space of
            the internet.

          <p>
            The Geography of Internet Access is described by the number of users
            per country that have access and use the internet. In the Graham et
            al text, this data is represented on an augmented world map where
            the size of the country is representative of the number of internet
            users within. <br />
            Compared to the traditional map of the world, this augmented map is
            distorted to show some countries and continents to be far larger
            than their traditional representations; China and the United States
            of America (USA) are shown to be far larger than Russia, the largest
            country in the world due to these countries having more users
            connected to the internet. <br />
            This augmentation also shows the Internet Penetration Rate (IPR) of
            each country - this is the percentage of any given country’s total
            population that has access to the internet. As a result we see that
            although China has the largest internet populace, countries such as
            Germany, Norway and Sweden have a greater IPR, meaning a greater
            portion of these country’s populace have access and may even have
            more users than China when combined. <br />
            What is interesting to note from this section is how small Africa is
            as the largest continent, Great Britain (GBR) which is roughly the
            same size as Madagascar, seems to be close to the size of Africa as
            a whole. However, unlike the situation between Sweden and China
            where Sweden has a smaller internet populace but has much deeper
            IPR, Africa averages 20%-40% IPR compared to GBR which boasts 80%+
            IPR. <br />
            In fact, the entirety of Europe is above 40% IPR, and is larger than
            North America despite Europe being almost a third of the size and
            having a higher average IPR. What this data could show is that
            Europe is ahead of the rest of the world in their development of
            internet technology or that there are internal factors inside other
            nations that have not allowed for as much of the population to
            access or use the internet. For instance, the Chinese internet
            populace could be being held back by Chinese Censorship laws, and
            these users being displayed are either enterprises with government
            allowed connections or users with Virtual Private Networks, or there
            are countries where the price of an internet connection can cost the
            same as 50 years working with the average national salary - such is
            the case in Eritrea. <br />
            As seen, there are factors that make or break a country’s citizen’s
            ability to connect to and use the internet fully, beit cost,
            inaccessibility, or laws.

          <h5 class="inBlog">Geography of Participation</h5>
          <p>
            The Geography of Participation is a measure of the contribution a
            given country has made to the internet and the world wide web. These
            contributions include domain names, active GitHub users and
            Wikipedia edits. Each of these aspects contribute to a country’s
            participation in the internet atmosphere. <br />
            Domain names are an indication of locally produced and released
            content in a country. GitHub users offer an indication of how many
            people of a given country are actively contributing to the global
            repository. Wikipedia edits give an indication of a country’s
            contribution to the global encyclopaedia. <br />
            Domain Names are useful to give an approximate location of origin
            for digital content, using these domains, content can be grouped
            fairly accurately to show the material produced from any given
            country. The Graham et al text uses an augmented map to show how
            these domains are grouped throughout the world. <br />
            The USA dominates this map, in both the number of domain names as
            well as the number of users on these domains. However, Europe as a
            whole outweighs any other continent, with GBR, Holland, and Germany
            leading the charge. This data shows that the USA controls the most
            domains and has the greatest internet population using these
            domains, but every country surrounding it has relatively little
            domain names under their control. Africa once again is virtually
            non-existent; out of Africa’s 54 countries, only 4 are able to boast
            more than 10 million users and more than 100 thousand domain names.
            <br />
            Africa’s non-existence is possibly a result of the factors that
            limit the number of internet users as a whole, being cost or
            inaccessibility due to other factors. In relation to all other
            continents, Africa has the least locally produced websites, and the
            USA has produced a massive majority of the world's websites. What is
            interesting is the difference between the outcome between South
            Africa and Nigeria compared to the last augmentation in which it
            showed Nigeria to have a much larger internet populace, however,
            South Africa in this augmentation is seen to have more users and
            more domain names and holding the majority in Africa’s users and
            domain names. This shows that South Africa despite having a smaller
            populace has contributed more to the internet than Nigeria since
            they have more associated domain names. <br />
            GitHub is the world's largest repository. By measuring how many
            users come from a given country, there will be some indication of
            how individuals contribute to the global programming community.
            <br />
            The Graham et al text displays this using GitHub’s own data showing
            the number of users per 100 thousand internet users are registered
            with GitHub and also how many commits each country's users have made
            over the history of GitHub. <br />
            The number of commits from a given country is something that has not
            been discussed. The number of commits shows exactly how many
            contributions a country’s users have made to the GitHub global
            repository and thus to the global programming scene. <br />
            Once more, the USA is leading in its contributions, accounting for
            35% of all commits made to GitHub, this may be affected by massive
            American companies such as Microsoft being large scale users of the
            product since close to its invention. Nonetheless, the USA has the
            largest user base for GitHub and has made the most commits to the
            repository, however despite the USA being a whale of users and
            contributions, North America falls short of having the most users,
            where Europe holds a larger chunk of both aspects. <br />
            However, unsurprisingly, Africa does not feature, holding less than
            1% of GitHub users in the world. However this could mean that Africa
            has far more independent, unregistered developers if the previous
            sets of data are to be taken into account given that Nigeria and
            South Africa have both featured previously as Africa’s leaders in
            Internet accessibility and usage. <br />
            While GitHub shows the number of developers that are actively
            contributing to global programming projects. Measuring a country’s
            Wikipedia edits shows how active a country is in terms of
            contributing to the world's largest base of compiled knowledge.
            <br />
            The most active countries according to the Graham et al text are the
            USA, GBR, France and Germany, this is unsurprising given the data
            that has been shown previously in the text. <br />
            However, Africa has the largest amount of grey area of any continent
            showing little grey areas in knowledge about the countries shaded
            grey and the information they are able to give the world. It has
            been seen that these countries are the most affected by the factors
            mentioned in the Geography of Access section, meaning that this is
            more a problem due to lack of internet access than not being able to
            contribute to Wikipedia. <br />
            The augmented map showing this data is a more traditional world map
            and clearly shows how much denser the data is in Europe and America
            (darker in colour, more Wikipedia edits made) compared to Africa and
            the rest of the world. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Geography of Representation</h5>
          <p>
            This is a representation of how much content there is pertaining to
            a given country on the Web. The Graham et al text refers to data
            captured from Google and OpenStreetMap (OSM) and reveals how popular
            a country is on the web and an approximate amount of information
            Google can provide about a country. <br />
            The information about search results was captured using the number
            of results generated by Google after searching the country’s name.
            This is not perfect since web pages can mention a country in the
            text without providing information about the country itself, but it
            still provides the much needed relevance of a country and will help
            to gauge how popular the country is based on the number of
            references found by Google. <br />
            From the graphic in the text, the USA has the most references on
            Google with close to one million references, however it only has 3.6
            pages per internet users, Chad has the greatest page per user ratio
            at over 400 references per user. <br />
            This data from Google shows how much information is readily
            available for an user using the Google search engine. However Google
            often finds pages that do not directly reference the page but uses
            implicit searching to find pages that may allude to the searched
            topic, making this data skewed and mainly useful for how much people
            talk about a country or an area of the world. <br />
            However, using OSM, there is a fairly clear indication how much is
            known about almost any area on the globe. OSM is a road map of the
            world and the density of nodes within a country or continent
            indicates how much data has been generated referencing the roads,
            and layout of a country. <br />
            As seen in the Graham et al text, there is a clear representation of
            this data. The data is displayed on another augmented map of the
            world shaded in different shades of green to represent the density
            of OSM nodes virtually anywhere in the world. <br />
            To no surprise, the USA and Europe hold the highest average
            densities of OSM nodes, indicating that there is more location data
            regarding those areas and Northern Africa is the most open area on
            the map save for Antarctica. <br />
            From the map, one could discern where a country’s capital city is by
            seeing the most dense regions of those countries or at least the
            country’s tourist destinations, for instance, one could easily see
            where Johannesburg and Cape Town are based on the density. <br />
            This data is far more useful when indicating how much information is
            known about a country as more OSM nodes indicate more locational
            data and more information ready to be accessed by internet users
            around the globe. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">
            Reflection on Data, Why is Africa so Far Behind?
          </h5>
          <p>
            According to Science, Africa is the birthplace of intelligent humans
            - the discovery of a “Scientific Adam”. So why is Africa not more
            developed than other continents, given it was set up to be the first
            base of civilization? <br />
            Most countries in Africa are stricken with poverty, and as a result,
            lack an adequate education system. Inequality affects this as well
            since poverty creates division in society based on wealth and the
            wealthy are able to be educated. <br />
            In 2021, it was found that over 40% of Africans above the age of 15
            are illiterate. That is a staggering number of people unable to read
            or write from the second largest continent. <br />
            Other factors come from the continent's leadership systems.
            Government policies go against innovation and technological
            advances. There are regions in Africa that lack electricity let
            alone an internet connection - a resource most take for granted
            because it's simply there now, a staple of modern life in most areas
            of Europe and America. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Conclusions</h5>
          <p>
            To sum up the basic outcome of all data in the Graham et al text,
            there is a clear technological divide between Africa and the rest of
            the world in regard to internet access, contributions, and
            representation. <br />
            Europe has the best internet penetration rate on average, USA has
            the largest active Internet populace. Africa is behind due to
            multiple factors, beit the cost of a broadband connection being more
            expensive than most could afford in a lifetime, or the simple lack
            of infrastructure to support the connection. <br />
            Africa is the second largest continent but it is dwarfed by much
            smaller continents in the field of internet technology and usership.
            Countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt are main contributors
            to Africa’s progression as a whole, but they are 3 countries out of
            54, and their efforts are not enough to bring the entire continent
            up to the standard set by other countries. <br />

          <h4>Importance of UIX and How Far Off I am.</h4>

        <summary id="UIX" class="blogEntry">

            The User Interface (UI), as the name suggests, is the medium through
            which the user is able to interact with the web page. How the user
            is able to interact is integral to forming the User Experience (UX).
            This relationship is mutual in a way due to the idea that good UI
            breeds good UX and vice versa, but another idea says that the best
            UI is one that goes unnoticed because of how seamless the experience
            becomes due to the interface's design and usability. <br />
            Good UI is usually designed with Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for
            User Interface Design, these are not necessarily rules, but form
            guidelines that can increase the usability of the interface and thus
            improve the UX across the board. Most of Nielsen’s Heuristics aim to
            negate the amount of work a user needs to do to understand and
            navigate the site - including complexity, readability, density and
            redundancy. <br />
            These guidelines can be related to It’s Not You… Bad Doors are
            Everywhere where Don Norman - an expert in Usability Engineering -
            explains how something as simple as a door is terribly designed and
            allows for errors too easily and how he would move to improve them
            as a whole, simply by changing how handles are presented to people
            using the door. <br />
            One of Nielsen’s Heuristics relates to Error Prevention, a common
            error is that people often push a ‘pull door’ due to most doors
            being designed symmetrically, i.e. there are handles on both sides
            of the door. Using Error Prevention, we would look at the door,
            choose the pull side and that side would have the handle while the
            other side is left without one since it prevents the user from even
            trying to pull the door. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Now Onto the Site...</h5>
          <p>
            It's time to gauge how usabl my site is in regards to Nielsen’s
            Heuristics and a few other resources. In terms of heuristics, some
            of them do not apply to this kind of site, specifically those that
            relate to user data or input. <br />
          </p>
          <h6>Visibility of System Status.</h6>
          <p>
            This is basically a fancy way of asking, does the site communicate
            where the user is and what is active on the page. For this site, the
            user needs to know what page they are on and what piece of writing
            is open on the blog page. Well, that was the plan. <br />
            The site does communicate what page the user is on by highlighting
            the link that corresponds to the current page, places a coloured
            ‘bubble’ around the link and shows where the user is against the
            dark background of the navigation bar. However I was yet to add
            anything that hides/opens the blog posts. <br />
            However in the next iteration, I plan to have the blogs be
            collapsible. And so the drop down will show which is open and will
            also be clear due to the text areas being in Ivory, a slightly off
            white, and the background being as dark as it is. <br />
            With the page as it is, there is no real need to show more regarding
            the site state, since, as a portfolio there is little input the user
            can give besides changing pages and eventually opening blog posts.
            However, I do feel these things can be reimplemented to be more
            clear or even more elegant. <br />
          </p>
          <h6>User Control and Freedom</h6>
          <p>
            Nielsen describes this as including an “Emergency Exit” since users
            often make mistakes and need an undo/redo button. In the case for
            the site, all pages are interconnected, meaning there are links to
            all pages from the navigation bar present in the header of each
            page. <br />
            In the next iteration, I intend to have the full blog posts on their
            own pages with previews on the main blog page and a “Read More”
            button that will take the user to the full post. This could prove to
            create a bottleneck of sorts however, depending on whether I include
            a full navigation bar or a simple return button. <br />
            The return button means that the user cannot go to any other page
            from the blog post thus limiting their freedom on those pages, but
            the return button does act as an “Emergency Exit” in case the user
            opened the incorrect post or did not mean to open the post.
            Excluding the navigation bar allows the user to focus on the post,
            however they will only have access to the main blog page. <br />
            Control and freedom are strange things to gauge especially when
            trying to create specific experiences, because with too much
            freedom, the experience becomes watered down and the balance is
            difficult to get right. With a portfolio site, you want to almos
            lead the user to something you want them to see fully and maybe try
            and limit their experience within areas you don’t want them spending
            much time or at least give them every possible way out of those
            areas. In my opinion, the blog posts are my weakest points, and so I
            am leaning toward giving the user every possible opportunity to
            leave them behind and checkout my Portfolio page, especially as that
            page fleshes itself out with every project I choose to include.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h6>Consistency and Familiarity</h6>
          <p>
            Consistency is specifically a style gauge. My site uses the same
            colour scheme throughout due to deliberately choosing a small colour
            palette. <br />
            In terms of container styling, all free standing containers had
            rounded corners to close off the containers without the use of a
            cumbersome border, there are some issues in this regard, slight
            reshuffles of colour, altered transparencies between similar
            containers on separate pages. However I don’t feel that that
            specifically needs to change. If something is too consistent it can
            become boring, and a portfolio website that fails to be engaging has
            essentially failed in its purpose as a tool for possible recruitment
            or entertainment. <br />
            Familiarity is more of a gauge of the cognitive load on the user.
            This is using localizations or colloquialisms that are more specific
            to people from our area or background. While these can make the site
            fresh and fun, they can force users who are not sure of the meanings
            to have to think heavily or even search it up to find where the site
            is going and what the site is doing. The proposed solution is
            following conventions that most other sites implement. <br />
            I do not think my site has many “Wrong doors” - i.e. none of the
            links lead somewhere they do not say they lead to, blogs lead to all
            the available blogs, portfolio leads to the projects I wish to
            include on my portfolio. The only thing I have included that does
            not do what is expected is the Hamburger menu button which does not
            work yet and is unusable. However the hamburger button as a symbol
            is a convention used across many sites and so will still be a
            familiar object to the user. <br />

          <h6>Less Technical Doodads</h6>

            In my opinion, a good UI includes very little unnecessary clutter,
            and thus does not include anything without purpose, by extension
            this includes white space. White space or empty space serves as
            “breathing” room for the user, it breaks up the components on screen
            and makes the page less daunting. <br />
            I feel that I succeeded in this for the most part, the blog page is
            problematic as I said previously with 4 large pieces of text
            following on from one another. This page is very heavy on the user’s
            mind and needs to be reduced to more manageable levels at least on
            the main page. <br />
            For a portfolio site I feel it needs to be more comfortable for the
            user; easy to understand, easy to navigate. Comfort can also apply
            to the colour scheme, the current colour scheme is very dark and
            includes a sometimes striking purple highlight. This combination is
            great to me, I enjoy high contrast schemes when the highlighted
            colour is very minimal, however the issue came in again with the
            blog page, the large ivory spaces although softened by the off-white
            hue were still very harsh against the dark background of the page
            itself. <br />
            As said with the feedback that I have received, the layout is wonky
            at times. This is possibly due to me developing the site on a much
            larger screen than the laptop screen, and so the site looked much
            better until a quick fix before submission after opening the site on
            the smaller screen. However this shows that I need to work on making
            the site more adaptive to sizing. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlock">So, in Conclusion</h5>
          <p>
            This reflection might have droned on for a bit too much, however it
            is all mostly relevant. <br />
            Using some of Nielsen’s Heuristics has helped me gauge my site’s
            interface. Although I did not use all 10, the 3 that I mentioned are
            the most important aspects in regards to this type of site i.e. a
            portfolio should not really focus on user input but rather on how
            the user is able to digest the site’s information as effortlessly as
            possible. <br />
            I feel that the aspect of my page that needs the most attention is
            the blog page, lessening the amount of text and distance on the
            site. <br />

          <h4>Internet, Society, and Design Justice</h4>

          <p>
            It is true that we cannot define the internet in the same way as we
            would have a few years ago, when it was simply a means to connect
            nodes around the world to one another. The internet has spread its
            tendrils of effect into almost every aspect of our lives. <br />
            Society is believed to have completely benefited from the expansion
            of the internet, however there are some communities that have become
            marginalized through these expansions, however me being privileged
            enough to have access to the internet I cannot account for their
            experiences myself. <br />
            This has brought about the idea of Design Justice, which is the
            approach to design led by marginalized communities that explicitly
            challenges the inequalities present on the internet. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">So, What’s the Problem?</h5>
          <p>
            As Nanjira Sambuli states, development of the internet has taken a
            “build it and they will come” ideology. Which essentially means that
            the development cycle ends at making the product and no further.
            <br />
            This is also evident when looking at the evidence presented in
            Towards a Study of Information Geographies, which shows the world
            through different lenses to show how some countries are dominating
            the internet space. The United States and Europe are developing and
            contributing the most to the international network while most other
            countries are simply just falling behind. <br />
            Could this be that there is no concerted effort from the leaders of
            the internet to help pick up those that are moving slower than they
            are, or that the people of those countries are just not able to
            contribute due to other factors outside of ability? Who can say, the
            divide will still present whether we know why it's here, being the
            elephant in the room. <br />
            To the end of lessening and ultimately negating the digital divide,
            civil societies have been formed to hold the governing bodies
            accountable and create an all-inclusive and transparent platform for
            governing emerging technologies. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">How Does Something Become “All-inclusive”</h5>
          <p>
            To be all-inclusive is to account for people of all walks of life.
            This mammoth task has suddenly become much larger than a single
            group can handle, and thus it must be taken as more of an
            overarching goal that all development squads should now be striving
            for. <br />
            The best method we have for developing inclusively is to center
            design around the values of a diverse team of individuals in an
            attempt to display and design for as many possible views as
            possible. <br />
            Good examples lie in the world of game design in which stories are
            told through more than just word of mouth. With today’s caliber of
            video games, we are in a position to tell more stories than ever
            before and those stories can be told by more than the plot, but
            rather through the mechanics and systems present therein. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Value-Centered Design: a Double-Edged Sword</h5>
          <p>
            As said, value-centered design is designing a system with the values
            of the team at the heart of the design process. However, some values
            can outshine others and the design become skewed to favor a specific
            view to some degree. <br />
            Flanagan recounts the experience of developing a game called
            REPUNSEL. Flanagan states that they used multiple frameworks to
            develop their methodology for value-sensitive design. Engineers are
            becoming much more aware that their own views and attitudes come out
            in the systems they build and how they implement their solutions.
            <br />
            These attributes of one’s character come out in the usability and
            functionality of the systems they work on. <br />
            It is this effect that pushes design teams to consider multiple
            approaches to a problem to take advantage of this bleed effect. With
            multiple members inputting their multitude of views into a project,
            that effect can reach many more walks of life, inching ever closer
            to that goal of creating an all-inclusive product that will reach as
            many people as possible. <br />
            However, as said, this could also pose problems since not all system
            modules are made equal in the eyes of a user, and thus the attitudes
            of the team member that works on the system closest to the surface
            runs the risk of overshadowing their team’s own values. <br />
            As a solution, a team might undertake an iterative development
            process in which the team analyses if all values that they deem
            important are represented and are represented equally through the
            system they have built thus far. This approach is another tool for
            teams to ensure their design philosophy and values can remain intact
            and evident in their final product. <br />
            This could very rarely be achieved on the first attempt, but more
            realistically this will be achieved after many reiterations, and
            even then the outcome is not the same as what would have been
            intended at the start of the project lifecycle, due to values, and
            goals being redefined. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Conclusion</h5>
          <p>
            From an engineering perspective, the message I put out through my
            code and systems has always been secondary to getting a working
            system out there. However, being more aware of how my code
            represents me is definitely something I want to work on instead of
            simply making a working system. <br />
            Value-centered design is definitely much more valuable for a team
            than an individual since there are multiple sets of values to take
            into account in a team. Thus, it is more the idea of being flexible
            in my ideals when working in a team while implementing what I learn
            from project to project in all my work as I go. <br />

            This iteration of the site was less enjoyable than the last. I felt
            that working on this site was more driven by obligation than a
            desire to learn and create a site that I can use to house my
            portfolio that I can use at a later stage to aid my career. <br />
            That being said, though, I still enjoyed this process, since the
            main goal is semi-simple - to make resizing more responcive in terms
            of element size and fonts and make the site 'friendlier'. <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Creative Reflection</h5>
          <p>
            My first goal was to make the color scheme less aggressive.
            Non-aggressive colors for me are darker shades of blue with white or
            at least close to white colors. As obvious choices the blues became
            container colors and accens, while the bright colors were used to
            house text unlesss a dark colored container that I wanted to be dark
            had text. This is only used on the nav bar and some headings though,
            so I am quite happy with how little I use this, and it acts as an
            accent on its own. <br />
            In my quest to find ways to spice up my styling, I found that I can
            alter the border radius of specific corners to round out some
            corners more than others. This is most prominent on the portfolio
            page since that is the tool I used to reinforce the assymmetry of
            the page since I did not want all the pictures on the page to be on
            the same side just as they were in the last iteration. <br />
            All in All I did not change much since I really liked the layout I
            used in the previous iteration with the problem areas falling within
            the blog page with text going across the entire screen and text not
            resizing with the window width. <br />
            <br />
            I definitely feel that my writings have improved from my previous
            submission simply on the basis that I used more resources to form
            the points and to drive the purpose of the pieces. I do know that
            that was a major loss on my part since I rushed my readings and
            writings to do the bare minimum for them. <br />
            A main contributng factor to this was sitting with a friend and
            woring through the readings and writing pieces together until they
            were finished.
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">Technical Reflection</h5>
          <p>
            From a technical point of view I feel I have improved slightly. I am
            slightly more semantic in my HTML - there are no divs. <br />
            I definitely feel I could use more JavaScript, however I am
            struggling to see places I can use it other than to collapse and
            open my blogs. Perhaps in the final shape of this site, I will use
            JavaScript to download files to user's machinesshould they want
            them. I feel that will e particularly useful with the portfolio page
            with my game builds being present and already linked to GitHub.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h5 class="inBlog">In Conclusion</h5>
          <p>
            I am quite happy with where my site is for the time being. I want to
            expand on the JavaScript capabilities of the site but I need t find
            what I need it for. I do not want JavaScript for the sake of having
            Javascript. <br />
            An important improvement I do want to make is a way fro the user to
            return to the top of a blog post after they have read it to
            completion, or that when a user opens a blog, that it closes all
            other blogs on the page. <br />
            I feel that there has too much on my plate for me to truly explore
            what JavaScript can do for me and that is possily why I have used so
            little of it. However the method I have implemented has worked quite
            nicely even though it is just a single line. <br />
