          <h2>My Current Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            This prototye is my attempt to reproduce the Batmobile from
            Rocksteady's Batman Arkham Knight. My goal is to reproduce the core
            functionality of the vehicle: Pursuit Mode and most of Battle Mode.
            Pursuit Mode functions as a standard car would, while Battle Mode
            turns the car into an all directional tank. That being said,
            replicating these behaviours has proven challenging in many ways.

          <h2>First Metroidvania Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            This is my first prototype for a metroidvania styled game. The goal
            is to reach the end of the level and touch the glowing ball. Players
            should find that reaching the ball may seem straight forward but
            they will need to take more of a scenic root to reach their goal as
            they need the abilities they gain during this process to cross the
            distance in the main area.

          <h2>Project ATLANTIS</h2>
          <p>
            To the right is an image of my current prototype for an open world
            role playing game. The game is in its very young and undeveloped
            stages but is progressing relatively quickly for the scope I intend
            to extend it to. The current goal is to include a level of polish by
            way of including some particle effects, updated animations, and new
            character models.
          </p>
          <p>
            This game is being built my me solely as a learning experience for
            the Game Development pipeline as a whole.
