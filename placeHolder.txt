        <h4>Augmentation of the Human Intellect through the Internet</h4>
        <summary>
          Augmentation refers to making something better by adding to it in
          various ways. In Douglas Englebart’s article titled Augmenting the
          Human Intellect (1962), it appeared to be an interesting and useful
          read. When thinking about Augmenting the Human Mind, I think about
          studying and learning new skills to solve new problems or find new
          paths to solve old problems.

        <h4>What is Semantic Markup, and what is it used for?</h4>
        <summary class="blogEntry">
          What is semantic markup? Breaking it down: semantic means to use a
          phrase or tool in a specific way that aligns with the true meaning of
          the reference, and markup is the use of tags,headings or notes to
          create a corresponding structure or meaning. Combining these two ideas
          gives a makeshift definition of what Semantic Markup is: a method of
          placing tags throughout a document to convey the documents true
          meaning through its structure and through the comments in the document
          reference.

        <h4>What is Metadata and How do We Use it?</h4>
        <summary>
          What is metadata? I found myself asking this when deciding on a topic.
          The shortest definition is data about data, almost like a movie about
          a movie. Metadata is not usually meant for the user to see, but it can
          be displayed. It fits into a few categories that have various uses,
          these categories including descriptive, structural and administrative
          metadata amongst other types. Each piece of data, however, can be
          placed in multiple categories simultaneously; a Harvard reference is a
          good example, since it holds the author’s name (descriptive), the
          publication date (Administrative) and the document type (structural).

        <h4>Geographies of the World Wide Web</h4>
        <summary>
          The dawning of the internet has allowed humanity to process and share
          information faster and to a much wider audience than ever before,
          however with this advance in the sharing and collection of knowledge
          certain degrees of inequalities in the form of access, contribution
          and representation have been able to creep into the system. These are
          made evident with the ability to visualise the map of the world in
          different contexts that match the aforementioned inequalities.

        <h4>Importance of UIX and How Far Off I am.</h4>
        <summary>
          The User Interface (UI), as the name suggests, is the medium through
          which the user is able to interact with the web page. How the user is
          able to interact is integral to forming the User Experience (UX). This
          relationship is mutual in a way due to the idea that good UI breeds
          good UX and vice versa, but another idea says that the best UI is one
          that goes unnoticed because of how seamless the experience becomes due
          to the interface's design and usability.
