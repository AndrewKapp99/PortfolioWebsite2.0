          <h2>The Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            Since I like the layout of my first submission I have chosen to keep
            the layout the same as that one. <br />
            The layout was simple, and the user could navigate to any page from
            anywhere on the site, which is something I wanted to kep as it
            aligns with good practice to give the user an out if they make a
            mistake. <br />
          </p>
          <h3>The Home/Landing Page</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              src="images/HomeWF.png"
              alt="Homepage wireframe"
              style="float: right; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10 px"
            />
            This page is the first page a user sees, it is meant to serve as an
            introduction to the site and to me. For this purpose, I have opted
            to assume readers will read the site from left to right and see the
            image of me first and then move to read the blurb on the right.
            <br />
            My picture is almost the same size as the blurb to keep the site
            somewhat balanced, while the image is rounded to a circle to allow
            for more open space. Peta's lecture mentioned that more open space
            in a site gives the user more breathing room to take in the site
            with less effort. To reinforce that idea, I have also placed
            everything in neat easy to see containers, so that users can see
            what is part of the site content and what is the open space. Giving
            the user the space to breathe is incredibly important especially
            with the blurb filling the right side of the screen with text.
          </p>
          <h3>The Blog Page</h3>
          <p>
            margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;
            <img
              src="images/BlogWF.png"
              alt="Blog page wireframe"
              style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px"
            />
            This page holds pieces of writing, and since most blogs are either
            multiple pages or lists of short articles I decided to place each
            piece in its own bubble to mark clear separations between pieces,
            while emphasizing the headings for each one to clearly mark which
            piece goes with which heading.
            <br />
            This page is all about communication and informaton, and thus the
            focus must be on the text. For this reason the text is placed in the
            centre and is the only thing that appears on the page for the most
            part.
            <br />
            I tried to introduce some more color into this page through the
            heading containers, since they also helped with the main goal of the
            site to have clear cuts between blog entries. The color pulls some
            attention towards itself and so reinforces the separations between
            pieces.
          </p>
          <h3 style="margin-top: 50px">Portfolio Page</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              src="images/PortfolioWF.png"
              alt="Portfolio wireframe"
              style="float: right; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px"
            />
            This is the page where my projects ar to be displayed. The premise
            is to give the user an idea of what I work on and the type of work I
            have done to this point.
            <br />
            To that end I elected that each entry for my portfolio should have a
            short description, an image and a link to the full project. Since I
            have very few scaled projects to this point that I have done outside
            of assignemnts, I have put a few assignemnts from last year and my
            current project up for viewing, the current build and the project
            files will be there.
            <br />
            The images and descriptions change sides to keep the page balanced,
            the images being in color pull far too much attention to themselves
            to be on a single side of the page together.
          </p>
          <h2>Style</h2>
          <h3>Color Choices</h3>
          <p>
            To choose my colors I used a site called Coolors.com.
            <br />
            As mentioned in my reflection I wanted to make the color cheme
            friendlier. To achive this I decided to use blues and shades of
            white such as platinum and ivory. <br />
            I also chose to replace the image backgrounds with a CS generated
            background simple to keep the site as consistent as possible, since
            the images brought in oo much diversity from page to page. WHile
            that goes against practice and having a different background is
            another way to inform the user where they are and the current state
            of the site, the nav bar already does an excellent job at that, and
            I want the site to feel like one complete thing as opposed to
            seeming lik different parts fused together.
          </p>
          <h3>Structure Choice</h3>
          <p>
            My choice to make my site appear as modular as possible (placing
            things in bubbles) comes from how I prefer to code. I prefer to make
            multiple classes/scripts to handle things in such a way that if I
            were to remove most of them the system would still function without
            them. In this case however it meant separating different parts from
            eachother that did not need to be connected.
            <br />
            I attempted to achieve this by using margins and padding to create
            open space between containers, and also by connecting things that
            needed to be connected to fill the class of the container, like the
            portfolio entries; they fill a single section container, but each
            section is separated from one another.
            <br />
            I also rounded most edges that do not touch the edges of the window
            to make the site feel more complete. The sharp edges can make a site
            feel tacky and uncomfortable in my opinion. <br />
            As seen on the home and portfolo pages, the edge of the text
            container and the corresponding image now touch. This is a decision
            I made to accentuate that the image and text are connected.
          </p>
          <h2>Technical Process</h2>
          <p>
            From a technical point of view, I simply tried to follow the
            structures and points André taught in his lectures on HTML and CSS,
            the starting structure of the site was the site André made in th
            lectures, however I decided to fill the inside with my own
            structures using the lessons.
            <br />
            The home page was simple eough, making the picture and blurb fill
            separate containers and then making them appear next to each other.
            <br />
            The portfolio page made a very weird issue. Since I was using the
            float property to say which side of the container the image sat
            meant the size of the container shrank to fit only the text without
            fitting the image as well. As a crude work around I made the size of
            the container a set size to fit the image with some extra space.
            While this does mean every cell is the same size, when the size of
            the window changes the height does not change to match how the image
            size and text area sizes change.
            <br />
            The blog page is simple as well, each blog post needs its own cell,
            that cell contains the heading that is made to stand out by use of
            extra color, and the text with the post contents which removes the
            blur filter in favor of the solid color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remembering a piece of informtion I found writing for the week 4
            assignment. I remembered that text containers such as article or
            section containers cause the h1 to automatically become h2, but h2
            containers do not become h3, and so I had to return to my pices that
            had multiple indented sections so that headings actually appear
            differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            All pages now use relative font and container sizes to aid the
            scalability of the pages. However functionality to imporove visuals
            on narrow sreens still needs to be implemented.
