          <h2>The Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            During my process to develop the site, I looked for examples of
            portfolio sites and ones that are used as examples on review or
            tutorial sites. With this approach I made notes of aspects I liked
            from the sites I saw and aspects I wanted to avoid in my own site.
            These aspects were adapted and translated into my running vision of
            the site and each page. Most of the sites that had something similar
            to a blog, however were not very helpful since the literature was
            placed on individual sites which I decided would be overkill for my
            small +/-700 word essays. Thus, I want my blogs to be on a single
            page with the hope of eventually making them collapsible when I
            integrate some Javascript into the site.
          </p>

            <img
              src="images/johngomez1.png"
              alt="Reference Image for site Inspiration"
              id="gomezRef"
            />
            This image is from Kevin Gomez's previous portfolio site, I like how
            minimalistic the site is. It makes for a good landing site, since
            you dont want a user to be overwhelmed as soon as they land on your
            site. I also like how easy it is for the eye to track directly to
            his picture, then to his name and finally to the links he has
            provided to social media and the other parts of his site.
            Unfortunately, he has updated the site since this image was taken
            and so I could not see how the rest of his site looked to see how
            the theme carries through his pages. I have decided to use the large
            image and simple design as part of my landing site.
            <br />
            Despite the site being one of my references and my main point being
            that the site had minimal text, I decided to place my About Me blurb
            on my landing page to keep the navigation bar cleaner without the
            extra button linking to the page.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 65px">
            <img
              src="images/stephanie-chizoba-website.jpeg"
              alt="Second site reference"
              style="float: right; height: 200px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px"
            />
            On the right, is the second reference I used, Stephanie Chizoba. She
            has a little bit more text to her landing page, it is more of of a
            welcoming spread to make users feel lore comforatble on her site as
            if to say "Make yourself at home". However once again I was mostly
            just interested in the layour of the page itself rather than the
            content therein. Her site leads the eye to read it from left to
            right, using color and font sizes to pull the eye to the left first
            and then over to her image to take in the entire landing.
            <br />
            What I like about this site is its simplicity, unfortunately, the
            rest of the pages of her site are not necassarily part of her own
            site except for the About page in which the structure is very
            similar but flipped so her article appears on the right, and the
            image on the left, it is the structure of that page I want to mimic
            with some aspects from Gomez's site such as the siz e of the image
            and the shape sincea circle among squraes pulls the most attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using these two sites as references for what to do and the Oracle
            Virtual Machine site as an example of what not to do, I set out to
            develop my siteaccording to the brief, starting by making a plain
            html site simply linking the pages together and then making the
            general layout for each page. Finally I style each page with its own
            layout to suit the content it needs.
          </p>
          <h3>The Home/Landing Page</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              src="images/HomeWF.png"
              alt="Homepage wireframe"
              style="float: right; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10 px"
            />
            This page is the first page a user sees, it is meant to serve as an
            introduction to the site and to me. For this purpose, I have opted
            to assume readers will read the site from left to right and see the
            image of me first and then move to read the blurb on the right.
            <br />
            My picture is almost the same size as the blurb to keep the site
            somewhat balanced, while the image is rounded to a circle to allow
            for more open space. Peta's lecture mentioned that more open space
            in a site gives the user more breathing room to take in the site
            with less effort. To reinforce that idea, I have also placed
            everything in neat easy to see containers, so that users can see
            what is part of the site content and what is the open space. Giving
            the user the space to breathe is incredibly important especially
            with the blurb filling the right side of the screen with text.
          </p>
          <h3>The Blog Page</h3>
          <p>
            margin:0px 10px 10px 0px;
            <img
              src="images/BlogWF.png"
              alt="Blog page wireframe"
              style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px"
            />
            This page holds pieces of writing, and since most blogs are either
            multiple pages or lists of short articles I decided to place each
            piece in its own bubble to mark clear separations between pieces,
            while emphasizing the headings for each one to clearly mark which
            piece goes with which heading.
            <br />
            This page is all about communication and informaton, and thus the
            focus must be on the text. For this reason the text is placed in the
            centre and is the only thing that appears on the page for the most
            part.
            <br />
            I tried to introduce some more color into this page through the
            heading containers, since they also helped with the main goal of the
            site to have clear cuts between blog entries. The color pulls some
            attention towards itself and so reinforces the separations between
            pieces.
          </p>
          <h3 style="margin-top: 50px">Portfolio Page</h3>
          <p>
            <img
              src="images/PortfolioWF.png"
              alt="Portfolio wireframe"
              style="float: right; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px"
            />
            This is the page where my projects ar to be displayed. The premise
            is to give the user an idea of what I work on and the type of work I
            have done to this point.
            <br />
            To that end I elected that each entry for my portfolio should have a
            short description, an image and a link to the full project. Since I
            have very few scaled projects to this point that I have done outside
            of assignemnts, I have put a few assignemnts from last year and my
            current project up for viewing, the current build and the project
            files will be there.
            <br />
            The images and descriptions change sides to keep the page balanced,
            the images being in color pull far too much attention to themselves
            to be on a single side of the page together.
          </p>
          <h2>Style</h2>
          <h3>Color Choices</h3>
          <p>
            To choose my colors I used a site called Coolors.com.
            <br />
            I new I wanted to have a darker theme, and so my first color was a
            dark grey and made my main cololr from there I chose the rest as
            colors that go well with the first color so that the site will have
            a dark color scheme with accented colors.
            <br />
            I chose dark colors because it is easier to emphasize specific parts
            ofthe site using colors, I chose to have purple highlights
            throughout the site since a bright purpe on a dark background can
            make for interesting settings. Pages also have varying amouns of
            highlights depending on how much of the background is visible.
            <br />
            With my two main colors chosen I used Coolors to choose colors that
            will work well with the shades I chose. Thes returned the off-white
            shade I use for blogs and the peachy orange I chose to use as the
            accent color for the nav bar and blog post headings.
            <br />
            I chose the orange-like color - called Light Coral, as the accent
            because the off white (Ivory) is perfect as an eye firendly text
            background due to its slightly dulled appearance.
          </p>
          <h3>Structure Choice</h3>
          <p>
            My choice to make my site appear as modular as possible (placing
            things in bubbles) comes from how I prefer to code. I prefer to make
            multiple classes/scripts to handle things in such a way that if I
            were to remove most of them the system would still function without
            them. In this case however it meant separating different parts from
            eachother that did not need to be connected.
            <br />
            I attempted to achieve this by using margins and padding to create
            open space between containers, and also by connecting things that
            needed to be connected to fill the class of the container, like the
            portfolio entries; they fill a single section container, but each
            section is separated from one another.
            <br />
            I also rounded most edges that do not touch the edges of the window
            to make the site feel more complete. The sharp edges can make a site
            feel tacky and uncomfortable in my opinion.
          </p>
          <h2>Technical Process</h2>
          <p>
            From a technical point of view, I simply tried to follow the
            structures and points André taught in his lectures on HTML and CSS,
            the starting structure of the site was the site André made in th
            lectures, however I decided to fill the inside with my own
            structures using the lessons.
            <br />
            The home page was simple eough, making the picture and blurb fill
            separate containers and then making them appear next to each other.
            <br />
            The portfolio page made a very weird issue. Since I was using the
            float property to say which side of the container the image sat
            meant the size of the container shrank to fit only the text without
            fitting the image as well. As a crude work around I made the size of
            the container a set size to fit the image with some extra space.
            While this does mean every cell is the same size, when the size of
            the window changes the height does not change to match how the image
            size and text area sizes change.
            <br />
            The blog page is simple as well, each blog post needs its own cell,
            that cell contains the heading that is made to stand out by use of
            extra color, and the text with the post contents which removes the
            blur filter in favor of the solid color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remembering a piece of informtion I found writing for the week 4
            assignment. I remembered that text containers such as article or
            section containers cause the h1 to automatically become h2, but h2
            containers do not become h3, and so I had to return to my pices that
            had multiple indented sections so that headings actually appear
            differently.
